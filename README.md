This is a Job Application Tracking Website. After signing up, using are able to document all their applications, create stages to track progression and make notes to refer back to. An intense job search can take you to many different sites, and applicants can easily lose track of their progression. This site provides a user friendly solution for users to stay in control of their search.

## Technologies Used

To create this site, I used Python, HTML and CSS. The back-end side was built using django, with django's built in authentication used to build the User model, sign in and sign out functionality.

## Next Steps

I would like to next make this site accessible for mobile users through media queries. In terms of functionality, I would like to build some visual graphs on the user profile page, reporting on success and where applicants have failed. In the long-term, it is the plan to build this application using a react front-end, in order to make the UI more dynamic.
